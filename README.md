# About this app (App Under Construction)

This web application allows you to combine and download multiple [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) files for different speedruns into one big set of splits with multiple customization options in mind. You can use this for multi-game speedruns, main board marathons, and for longer categories that consist of multiple smaller ones. Eveyrything is performed on the client-side within your web browser so nothing will ever be sent or stored onto a server.
