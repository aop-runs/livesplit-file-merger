# LiveSplit File Merger

A simple React web application that allows you to combine multiple [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) files from different speedruns into one big splits file that you can then download. You can use this tool for multi-game speedruns, main board marathons, and for longer categories that consist of multiple smaller ones. Everything is performed on the client-side within your web browser so nothing will ever be sent or stored onto a server.

## Features

### Drag N' Drop Functionality
* Upload .lss files by dragging them onto the upload container (or manually by clicking it)
* Reorder your entries by smoothly dragging each entry to its desired spot within your run using [@dnd-kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/)
