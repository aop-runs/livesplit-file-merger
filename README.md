# About

This web application allows you to combine multiple [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) files from different speedruns into one big set of splits that you can then download. You can use this tool for multi-game speedruns, main board marathons, and for longer categories that consist of multiple smaller ones. Everything is performed on the client-side within your web browser so nothing will ever be sent or stored onto a server.
